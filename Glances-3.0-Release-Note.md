### A new way to have only REST API available and disable WEB GUI access #1149

It is now possible to run the Restful API without the Web User Interface (UI) using the --disable-webui option.

Web UI and API (default Web server mode):

```
#Â glances -w
Glances Web User Interface started on http://0.0.0.0:61208/
```

Web API without UI:

```
# glances -w --disable-webui
Glances Restful API Server started on http://0.0.0.0:61208/api/3/
```

### Refactor graph export plugin (& replace Matplolib by Pygal) #697

The export module has been completely refactor and the Matplotlib graph generation lib replaced by Pygal. You can generate dynamic graphs (SVG format) in a target folder. The generation starts every time the 'g' hotkey is pressed in the CLI interface or every 'generate_every' seconds (see the configuration key in the glances.conf file).

Example og graph section in the glances.conf file:

```
[graph]
# Configuration for the --export graph option
# Set the path where the graph (.svg files) will be created
# Can be overwrite by the --graph-path command line option
path=/tmp
# It is possible to generate the graphs automatically by setting the
# generate_every to a non zero value corresponding to the seconds between
# two generation. Set it to 0 to disable graph auto generation.
generate_every=60
# See followings configuration keys definitions in the Pygal lib documentation
# http://pygal.org/en/stable/documentation/index.html
width=800
height=600
style=DarkStyle
```

and run Glances with:

```
$ glances --export graph
```

Example of output (load graph)

> Note: SVG files can be openned in every modern Web Browser.

### Docker module shows details about stopped containers #1152

A new configuration key has been added in the Glances configuration file (default value is False). Set it to True to display all the containers

[docker]
# By default, Glances only display running containers
# Set the following key to True to display all containers
all=True

Result in the curses interface:
